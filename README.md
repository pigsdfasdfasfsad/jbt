# TWR Offline

Durable development repository for the standalone offline reconstruction of **Those Who Remain**.

## Locked target

- Windows standalone game using Godot 4 + C#/.NET.
- No Roblox, Roblox Studio, Roblox account, Roblox server, or Internet connection at runtime.
- Local-authoritative single-player simulation with command/event boundaries suitable for later LAN/co-op work.
- Older-style **Regular-only, 15-wave** release profile. Wave 15 completes the map; there is no wave 16.
- Hardcore, Classic, Endless, enemy Juggernauts, Juggernaut waves, and ordinary-hit movement stun are disabled.
- Completion reward is one-time and is persisted before results/lobby transition.
- Release maps: Ranch, Mill, Bypass, Cabin, Cargo, District, Expressway, Prison, Laboratory, Manor.

## Recovery status

This branch contains the latest recoverable development state assembled from surviving engineering artifacts and immutable source evidence. The previous full working tree did not survive byte-for-byte. Files restored from surviving artifacts, files deterministically regenerated from recovered normalized evidence, and newly reconstructed implementation files are distinguished in `recovery/PROVENANCE.json` and `docs/RECOVERY_STATUS.md`.

The historical engineering report records **82/82 tests**, **78 C# files**, **21 acceptance gates**, ten converted source maps, and **14,363 normalized RemoteSpy calls**. Those are historical checkpoint facts, not automatically current claims. Run `python tools/validation/run_all.py` for current repository truth.

## Evidence policy

Original uploaded evidence remains immutable and outside ordinary public Git history. This repository stores hashes, manifests, normalized data, generated reconstruction outputs, tests, source code, and documentation. Raw `.rbxlx`/`.rbxl`, raw evidence ZIPs, raw recordings, and release binaries are intentionally excluded.

## Validation

```text
python -m pip install -e .[test]
python tools/validation/run_all.py
```

## Windows output

The pinned workflow targets:

`build/output/ThoseWhoRemainOffline.exe`

A successful executable build is only claimed after the Windows workflow actually produces that file.

## Windows executable distribution

The Windows CI workflow validates, exports, and smoke-tests the game in its
temporary runner workspace. It intentionally does **not** publish executables
or upload downloadable Windows builds to GitHub Actions or GitHub Releases.
Previously uploaded Windows build artifacts are removed during the next CI run.

The project owner distributes packaged builds separately, outside GitHub.

## Laboratory source-pack runtime verification

Laboratory can load an external, owner-held `Content/Maps/Laboratory.scene.jsonl.gz`
beside the Windows executable. Original Roblox geometry bytes remain out of Git.

The Windows workflow now generates a **synthetic**, explicitly marked Laboratory
scene with 30,000 dummy render instances, 1,000 dummy colliders, 801 dummy lights,
15 infected spawn markers, and 8 player spawn markers. It loads that pack through
the **exported Windows executable** and requires both `TWR_LAB_SOURCE_LOADED`
and `TWR_SMOKE_LAB_SOURCE_OK` in the process log. The fixture is deleted at
the end of the smoke step and is never distributed. This validates loader
execution and pack discovery, **not** fidelity to the original Laboratory.
